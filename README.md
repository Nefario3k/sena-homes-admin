## My process

### Built with

- NUXT
- BootStrap
- Vuetify
- Semantic HTML Markup
- CSS3
- Vue2-editor

### What I learned

As a process of documenting progress, i include this sectiion in my projects. I learned proper use of css grid styles, in raw CSS3, Boostrap grid associated classes, BootStrap Vue(though not included in this project), Vuetify UI Component!

### Continued development

The project is made to be responsive on all viewport but one thing that i desire more in my project is bringing more life and user engagement to each section and the whole project as whole. To accomplish this, i would be venturing more into calling css styles using an intersection observer and also mastering the pulish library ![AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). Then Three.js would be my next journery.

### Useful resources

- [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
